# OpenLLMs-for-Text-Summarization
The code uses the BART model to summarize text and calculates ROUGE scores to evaluate the quality of the generated summaries compared to human-written ones in a dataset. It reads data, generates summaries, computes ROUGE scores (ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, ROUGE-L), and presents the scores in a table using Pandas DataFrame.

Conclusion
This code showcases the application of the BART model for text summarization and demonstrates the assessment of summary quality using ROUGE scores. It enables users to evaluate the effectiveness of the BART model in summarizing text data.
