# OpenLLMs-for-Text-Summarization
The code uses the BART model to summarize text and calculates ROUGE scores to evaluate the quality of the generated summaries compared to human-written ones in a dataset. It reads data, generates summaries, computes ROUGE scores (ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, ROUGE-L), and presents the scores in a table using Pandas DataFrame.
